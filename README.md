## A Django Board

This is a basic login and comment thread site written in [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

This web application built using the Django framework creates a basic commenting site on any topic. The associated website also allows blog authors to create text-only blogs using the Admin feature. Any logged-in users may choose to add comments with the help of a form provided on the website. Users can also list all bloggers, blogs, and other details (including comments for each blog).
